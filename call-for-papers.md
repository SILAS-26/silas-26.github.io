- Camera-ready deadline: 17 May 2026
- Workshop date: 12 June 2026

———————————————————————-

## Scope

The SILAS workshop brings together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to explore how sustainability intersects with software engineering practices and large language models (LLMs). We encourage participation regardless of whether you publish at SILAS, as we appreciate the value of diverse insights and active dialogue.

LLMs are rapidly becoming part of everyday software engineering workflows. Their integration into tasks such as requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance—combined with large CI/CD pipelines—raises important questions about energy use and resource consumption. Understanding and reducing this footprint is increasingly urgent.

The second edition of SILAS will be held fully on-site and features a keynote (TBA), paper presentations, and structured roundtable discussions aimed at identifying challenges and opportunities for more sustainable LLM-assisted software engineering.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- empirical studies on the environmental or resource impact of LLM-assisted software engineering
- datasets, benchmarks, or measurement methodologies for evaluating LLM efficiency
- tools, techniques, and practices for reducing the resource footprint of LLM-assisted tasks across the software engineering lifecycle
- profiling, analysis, or characterization of LLM behavior in SE contexts
- efficient and repeatable prompting strategies, including resource-efficient code generation
- industrial experiences, case studies, or demonstrations

Accepted papers will be published in the ICT4S 2026 Workshops Proceedings (CEUR), see submission guidelines below.


## Participation 
Attendance is open to all ICT4S participants. We particularly encourage individuals interested in sustainable software engineering, AI-assisted development, LLM efficiency, and related topics. You are welcome to join SILAS even if you do not plan to publish; we value constructive dialogue and diverse perspectives.

## Keynote (To be announced)

## Tentative Program (To be announced)

## Submission guidelines

Submissions must use the 1-column CEUR template (ODT or Overleaf).

We invite three categories of papers:
- Research papers (10-15 standard pages) present mature and well-motivated work that advances the understanding of sustainable LLM-assisted software engineering. These submissions will be evaluated for relevance, novelty, soundness, and readability
- New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) papers (5–9 standard pages) present early-stage, promising, or provocative ideas that have the potential to open new research directions in sustainable LLM-assisted software engineering. These submissions may describe novel concepts, under-explored challenges, initial observations, or emerging results that are not yet mature enough for a full research paper. The emphasis is on insight, originality, and the capacity to stimulate discussion. NIER papers will be evaluated for their relevance, novelty, potential impact, and clarity.
-  Industrial application & demonstration papers (5–9 standard pages) present practical experiences, applications, tools, or demonstrations related to sustainable LLM-assisted software engineering. Submissions may describe real-world deployments, lessons learned, performance observations, or applied techniques used in industry or public-sector contexts. These papers should clearly convey the practical relevance and insights gained from implementation or use. Industrial and Demonstration papers will be evaluated for their relevance, practical value, and clarity of presentation.

All submissions must be original and peer-reviewed by a program committee of international experts.

## Post-workshop Community Paper

A central goal of SILAS is to build a scientific foundation for this emerging area. After the workshop, we will collaboratively develop a scientific paper summarizing the main insights, directions, and challenges identified during the event. Authorship will be offered to participants who actively contribute to the writing process after the workshop.


## Organisation committee

### Organizers
* Pepijn de Reus is a guest researcher at the University of Amsterdam's Complex Cyber Infrastructure
 research group. Pepijn co-organised last year's workshop on SusPETs
* Maja H. Kirkeby is an Associate Professor at Roskilde University, Denmark. Recently, she has served as co-organiser of the 2024 Dagstuhl Seminar “Power, Energy, and Carbon-Aware Computing on Heterogeneous Systems”, GreenAI'25, the Workshop on Resource Awareness of Systems and Society 2024, and the QUATIC '24 track "Sustainability as a Quality Concern (SQC)".
* Fernando Castor is an Associate Professor at the University of Twente, The Netherlands. Fernando has served as workshop co-chair for ICT4S'22
 and co-organiser of the ASE 2021 AeSIR workshop, among many other events.
* Ana Oprescu is an Assistant Professor at Universiteit van Amsterdam. She co-organised SATToSE'20 Amsterdam (the first online edition due to COVID-19) and co-organised the ICT4S 2024 SusPETs workshop.
* João Paulo Fernandes is a Visiting Associate Professor at New York University Abu Dhabi. In areas related to this proposal, João served as General Co-chair for ICT4S'22 and as co-organiser for GreenAI'25 and last year's SusPETs. Beyond these topics, he also served as General Co-chair for IFL'23 and VL/HCC'18.
